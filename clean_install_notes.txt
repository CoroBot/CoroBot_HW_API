Setup notes:

Raspbian
Download tarball for Python3.4 and ZMQ

Download prereqs:

sudo apt-get install libtool pkg-config build-essential autoconf automake libssl-dev openssl

Both of these can be created with the ./configure
make
sudo make install

but with the Python3.4, you might need to include a flag that forces PIP to be installed:

./configure --with-ensurepip=install

And with ZMQ, run "sudo ldconfig" after "sudo make install".

Ensure that PIP gets installed, as it is the easiest
way to install python ZMQ bindings.
